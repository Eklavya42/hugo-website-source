***

Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student at Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi. I am pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology and Mathematics with a minor in Systems Biology.


I had an opportunity of interning at Defence Research and Development Organisation (D.R.D.O.), working on mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. As a student, I have been extensively involved in various projects in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics.

My domain interests include Artificial Intelligence, Computational Biology and Quantum Computing. I am especially interested in the application of Deep Learning towards the healthcare sector and genomics. My goal is to build innovative healthcare solutions powered by artificial intelligence.


My main focus right now is developing automated diagnosis of patients using computer vision techniques which will improve the screening methods and detect diseases at early stages.
